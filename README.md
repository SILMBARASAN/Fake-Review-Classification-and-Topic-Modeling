# Fake Review Classification and Topic Modeling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying fake reviews in e-commerce platforms using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system performs review classification and topic modeling to identify patterns and insights from textual data.

## Features
- **Fake Review Classification**: Classifies reviews as genuine or fake using machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Topic Modeling**: Extracts key topics from reviews to analyze recurring patterns.
- **Real-Time Inference**: Provides a Flask-based API for real-time predictions.
- **Containerized Deployment**: Uses Docker for efficient deployment and scalability.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language for all operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Used for implementing machine learning algorithms such as classification and clustering.
- **TensorFlow**: Utilized for building deep learning models like LSTM and BERT for review classification.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For leveraging pre-trained models for sentiment analysis and text classification.
- **Flask API**: Allows real-time inference and interaction with the model.
- **Docker**: Facilitates containerization for deployment and scalability.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load and clean the dataset (e.g., remove stopwords, punctuation, and special characters).
   - Tokenize and vectorize the text data using TF-IDF or other embedding methods.

2. **Model Development**:
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for review classification.
   - Perform topic modeling using techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Real-Time Inference**:
   - Develop a Flask API for real-time predictions on new reviews.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Containerize the application using Docker for scalable and portable deployment.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-review-classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fake-review-classification
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- **API Endpoint**:
  - Use the `/predict` endpoint to classify reviews by sending a POST request with the review text.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"review": "This product is amazing!"}' http://localhost:5000/predict
    ```

## Results
- **Classification**: Achieved an accuracy of XX% with the BERT model.
- **Topic Modeling**: Identified key topics such as product quality, customer support, and delivery experience.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset for better generalization.
- Integrate additional pre-trained models for improved accuracy.
- Enhance the API with a user-friendly front-end interface.
